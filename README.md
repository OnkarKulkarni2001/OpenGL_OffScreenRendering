# OpenGL_OffScreenRendering

ðŸš€ Dynamic Control Room Screens with Offscreen Rendering! ðŸš€

Excited to share a new feature in my custom game engine: offscreen rendering using FBOs to create immersive, dynamic control room screens!

ðŸ”¹ Live Camera Feeds: Screens inside the control room display real-time views of the space station, changing at set intervals.

ðŸ”¹ Realistic Screen Effects: Some screens simulate static and flickering, enhancing the atmosphere of a worn-out space station.

ðŸ”¹ Moving Textures & UI: Text on flickering/static screens moves dynamically, adding to the immersive feel.

ðŸ”¹ Environmental Details: Fingerprint and scratch textures on the control room windows enhance realism.

ðŸ”¹ Built from Scratch: Developed using OpenGL, GLAD, and C++, focusing on efficient framebuffer management and post-processing effects.

This project deepened my understanding of offscreen rendering, post-processing, and real-time scene management. Excited to explore even more advanced rendering techniques!

How would you use offscreen rendering in a game? Letâ€™s discuss! ðŸŽ®
